## Inspiration

This was made in response to pointless school projects in which you need a
certain amount of data to discuss some kind of topic. Sometimes, the data itself
is not the important part, rather it is the discussion. Thus, sufficient data to
progress the discussion is needed.

## User-friendliness

User-friendliness was not a priority since this is a "garbage" script made to
solve a quick affectless problem for convenience purposes. You have to scrap
your way using this script; it is a more of a guide than a usable tool.
